         "On 19 December 2024, a cyber attack attributed to Russian state-sponsored actors linked to the GRU temporarily disrupted Ukraine's state registries, managed by the Ministry of Justice. The attack, described as the largest of its kind on the country's registries, suspended online services for administrative matters like marriages, car registrations, and changes of residence.\nDeputy Prime Minister and Justice Minister Olha Stefanishyna stated the attack aimed to \"instill panic among Ukrainian citizens and those abroad\" and noted it had been prepared for several months. While no data leaks or thefts have been confirmed, all registries remain offline as a precautionary measure. Restoration efforts are underway, with basic services expected to resume within two weeks. Ukrainian authorities, including the SSU, are conducting a criminal investigation, with suspicions centered on a GRU-affiliated hacker group.",

         "Unit 42 researchers uncovered a phishing campaign targeting European companies, particularly in Germany and the UK, within automotive, chemical, and industrial compound manufacturing industries from June 2024 to at least September 2024. Palo Alto Networks reported the campaign and its findings on December 18, 2024.\nThe campaign aimed to harvest account credentials to take over victims' Microsoft Azure cloud infrastructure. Attackers used phishing emails containing malicious PDFs or HTML links created via the HubSpot Free Form Builder service. Victims clicking these links were redirected to credential-harvesting pages disguised as legitimate Microsoft login portals.\nThis campaign targeted approximately 20,000 users. Once credentials were harvested, attackers exploited them to access Microsoft Azure accounts, conduct lateral movements, and establish persistent control, even during active attempts to block their access. The attackers also used VPN proxies to mask their origins and mimic logins from trusted locations.",

The attack caused long queues in the stores during the weekend of 14-15 December 2024, with a limited number of cases in service, and employees had to enter product codes manually. The company, with 13 addresses in Quebec, was conducting an in-depth analysis with cybersecurity experts to determine what has been affected in their systems. The attack has slowed down some activities, with some cases closed in all branches, but supermarkets remain open and operational. The incident was disclosed by Serge Gauthier, Executive Vice-President, in an email sent to Le Soleil on 17 December 2024. At the time of reporting on December 17, 2024, there is no indication that personal information from employees and clients was disclosed during the cyberattack.",

The group alleged the theft of 270 GB of sensitive data, including contractual documents, network architecture diagrams, IT administration tool interfaces, and Ecritel’s information system security plan (ISSP). Despite these claims, Ecritel reported that the attack was swiftly detected and thwarted without disrupting business continuity or customer platforms.\nEcritel's investigation, supported by a PASSI-certified third-party audit, concluded that only an internal server containing employee working documents was compromised and partially exfiltrated.

The PDI informed the municipality of a massive attack from China targeting the social media platforms of public entities with many followers. The hackers' goal was likely to sell the accounts online.

The backdoor, which shares similarities with the Winnti backdoor, was discovered by researchers at QiAnXin XLab, who reported the incident on December 12, 2024. Glutton was found to be embedded in an archive downloaded from the Timibbs cybercrime online market and linked to a fraudulent click-farming platform. The backdoor can extract sensitive system data, deploy an Executable and Linkable Format backdoor, and inject malicious code into PHP frameworks like Baota, ThinkPHP, Yii and Laravel. The attackers used poisoned tools to turn cybercrime operators into unwitting pawns, with the malware operating stealthily within PHP or PHP-FPM FastCGI processes. The victims of Glutton span various sectors, particularly in IT services and business operations, and include systems used by cyber criminals, with the majority of them located in China.",

         "The Serbian Security Intelligence Agency (BIA) accessed the mobile phone of an unnamed activist of the NGO Krokodil and stole information beginning on October 1, 2024",
         "Amnesty International investigated a case involving an activist from the NGO Krokodil who suspected tampering with their phone following an October 2024 interview with Serbian BIA officials. Krokodil, an organization advocating for reconciliation in the Western Balkans and openly supporting Ukrainian and Russian dissidents, has faced frequent threats and vandalism, including a September 2024 incident where Russian-speaking intruders removed a Ukrainian flag from their office.\nOn October 1, 2024, after requesting a meeting with BIA regarding the incident, the activist was interviewed at the Ministry of Interior in Belgrade. Before the questioning, BIA officials asked the activist to restart their phone, which he unlocked using a pattern-based PIN. Although the officials could not visibly observe the unlock pattern, room cameras likely captured it. During the interview, which lasted from 10:17 to 11:40, the activist’s phone was left unattended in their jacket outside the room.\nUpon leaving the interview, the activist noticed suspicious activity on their Samsung Galaxy S24+, including a notification that their contacts had been exported at 10:38. Confronting BIA officials yielded denials, prompting the activist to seek Amnesty International’s Security Lab assistance.\nForensic analysis confirmed that two spyware applications, NoviSpyAdmin and NoviSpyAccess, were installed on the phone during the interview. Logs revealed that at 10:20, the phone was powered on shortly after the interview began and connected to a ThinkPad X1 Yoga via USB. Authorities used the Android ADB protocol to gain control, disable security features, and manually browse the device, including its photo gallery, while exporting contacts.\nNoviSpyAdmin, a device admin app, collected sensitive data such as call logs, contacts, SMS messages, and audio recordings. NoviSpyAccess exploited Android accessibility features to capture screenshots, track location, exfiltrate files, and activate the phone’s camera. By 10:27, NoviSpyAccess was configured as the active accessibility service, enabling comprehensive surveillance.\nThe spyware remained active on the device at the time of Amnesty International’s analysis, uploading screenshots of sensitive information, including emails, Signal and WhatsApp messages, and social media activity, to a spyware server. Data logs confirmed that NoviSpy communicated with IP addresses linked to Telekom Srbija, a government-controlled ISP.\nAmnesty International reported on many cyber incidents against Serbian civil society. Amnesty International attributed this cyber incident to the Serbian Security Intelligence Agency\n (BIA). Amnesty International also wrote that Google was able to identify further incidents, i.e. incidents outside of the ones mentioned in the Amnesty International report.

         "In November 2024, Amnesty International conducted a forensic analysis of the phone belonging to Nikola Ristić, a youth activist. The analysis confirmed that the phone was infected with NoviSpy spyware after being unlocked using Cellebrite UFED while in Serbian authorities' custody.\nNikola was a key organizer of a protest in Belgrade following the tragic collapse of a train station roof in Novi Sad, which killed 14 people and injured dozens on November 1, 2024. On November 3, Nikola and his partner arrived at Belgrade’s Trg Republike carrying red paint for the protest. Shortly after, they were stopped by four men who identified themselves as BIA officers. Despite Nikola’s initial resistance due to the absence of a warrant, he was taken to a police station after a brief altercation, during which an officer threatened him and acted aggressively.\nNikola’s belongings, including his phone, were confiscated at the station. During questioning, officers returned his phone and instructed him to call his partner to request the removal of a video of his arrest circulating on social media. After the call, his phone was taken out of the room. Nikola was interrogated; he perceived the questioning as a tactic to waste time, and no court order was presented to justify his detention. He was released after over two hours, around 1:30 PM.\nSuspicious of tampering, Nikola contacted Amnesty International’s Security Lab. Forensic analysis of his Huawei Honor 20 Pro revealed traces of NoviSpy spyware installed during his detention, with evidence showing physical access to his device via the Android ADB protocol.  One week after the infection, the spyware was still active, and logs indicated that operators had reconfigured it to upload data every three minutes, showing active device management. The analysis also confirmed that Cellebrite UFED was used to unlock the phone before the spyware installation.\nAmnesty International reported on many cyber incidents against Serbian civil society. Amnesty International attributed this cyber incident to the Serbian Security Intelligence Agency (BIA). Amnesty International also wrote that Google was able to identify further incidents, i.e. incidents outside of the ones mentioned in the Amnesty International report.

         "Amnesty International conducted a forensic analysis of the Android phone belonging to Serbian journalist Slaviša Milanov, who suspected tampering by Serbian authorities. Milanov, an investigative journalist from Dimitrovgrad working with the FAR news portal, focuses on sensitive topics such as local government spending and corruption.\nOn February 21, 2024, Milanov and a colleague were stopped by traffic police en route to a business meeting in Pirot. He was taken to the police station for additional tests for alcohol and drugs, which were conducted after a 20-minute delay and returned negative results. During his time at the station, Milanov was asked to leave his belongings, including his phone, and was later questioned by two men in civilian clothes about his journalistic work and the financing of FAR. Following the questioning, his devices were returned, but Milanov noticed unusual behavior on his phone, such as mobile data and Wi-Fi being turned off and excessive battery use by certain apps.\nSuspecting unauthorized access, Milanov installed a security app, which revealed that some apps were accessed and new ones installed while he was in custody. Amnesty International’s Security Lab confirmed that NoviSpy spyware apps were covertly installed on his Xiaomi Redmi Note 10S during his detention. The analysis also found evidence that Cellebrite’s UFED forensic tool was used to unlock the phone, enabling the spyware installation.",

         "On 27 November 2024, Argentina's National Atomic Energy Commission (CNEA) was targeted in a ransomware attack attributed to the Money Message strain, first identified in 2023. The attack impacted all CNEA headquarters, encrypting data and disrupting the organization’s administrative network. The attackers demanded a cryptocurrency ransom in exchange for a decryptor. Although the CNEA assured that no project-related information was accessed, experts warn that data breaches often lead to leaks on the dark web shortly after such incidents. The Argentine government acknowledged the attack, and an official investigation is underway by the judiciary, with additional oversight from the Access to Public Information Agency",

         "On 14 December 2024, Turkey's highway and bridge transit system, HGS, suffered a major cyber attack by the hacker group 'hades_hgs'. The attackers infiltrated the HGS database, stealing personal and financial data of over 5 million users, which was subsequently shared on the Dark Web. The group demanded a ransom of $25,000 and threatened to release additional sensitive information, including over a million credit card records, if their demands were not met. The attack is reportedly linked to a dispute involving a lawyer named 'Juadis.'\nOn December 16, 2024, various Turkish media reported on the detainment of two suspects linked to the beach of the Turkish Highway and Bridge Transit System (HGS). Involved law enforcement authorities, namely the Denizli and Mersin Provincial Gendarmerie Commands coordinated by the Department of Combating Cybercrimes and in cooperation with the National Intelligence Organization (MIT) and the Information and Communication Technologies Authority (BTK) and the Computer Emergency Response Team of Turkey (TR-CERT), detained Veli B. (also known as Hades) and Burak K. (also known as Klew) on suspicion of unauthorized access to information systems and sharing messages insulting national and religious values. During the investigation, Veli B. was arrested, while Burak K. was released under judicial control. It was noted that Burak K. admitted on social media that the cyber attack was carried out as a joke. ",

         "In December 2024, unknown threat actors, later identified as the RA World Ransomware gang, launched a ransomware attack against Compass Communications, a New Zealand-based telecommunications provider. The attack compromised both the confidentiality and integrity of the company's systems, with the attackers claiming to have exfiltrated 250 gigabytes of internal and customer data, including financial records, customer details, human resources files, and information on ongoing projects. As evidence of the breach, a 26.9-megabyte archive of sample data was posted on the gang's darknet leak site.\nCompass Communications confirmed the breach to Cyber Daily, revealing that their security monitoring had detected unauthorised access to their systems the previous week. The company promptly engaged external cybersecurity experts and notified relevant government authorities. An initial investigation suggested that some customer information may have been accessed. The RA World Ransomware gang set a ransom deadline of 1 January 2025.",

         "In late 2023 and mid-2024, Iranian threat actors, specifically the CyberAv3ngers group, used a new malware named IOCONTROL to compromise Internet of Things (IoT) devices and OT/SCADA systems in Israel and the United States, Claroty's Team82 reported on December 10, 2024. The targeted devices included routers, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), IP cameras, firewalls, and fuel management systems from various manufacturers, including D-Link, Hikvision, Baicells, Red Lion, Orpak, Phoenix Contact, Teltonika, and Unitronics. \nOn October 14, 2024, the threat actors claimed to have compromised 200 gas stations in Israel and the U.S. on Telegram, which aligns with Claroty's findings. Claroty's Team82 confirmed that the threat actors compromised several hundred Israeli-made Orpak systems and U.S.-made Gasyboy fuel management systems. This happened in one go from mid-October 2023 to January 2024 until they resumed their attack from July to August 2024.",

Krispy Kreme, which operates 1,521 shops and 15,800 points of access, detected unauthorized activity and engaged leading cybersecurity experts to address the incident. The breach has materially impacted the company's operations, with anticipated financial losses due to reduced digital sales, fees for cybersecurity experts, and system restoration costs. The company's stock price dropped by 2% following the disclosure. Krispy Kreme revealed the attack in an SEC filing on 11 December 2024, along with an update on its website about operational disruptions. No ransomware groups have claimed responsibility, and the investigation remains ongoing with no timeline for recovery provided.",

         "Beginning in at least July 2024, unknown threat actors launched a sophisticated global phishing campaign targeting employees of 30 companies across 12 industries, distributing over 200 malicious links designed to steal user login credentials, with stolen credentials sent to attackers in real time via C2 servers or Telegram bots. Cybersecurity researchers at Group-IB reported on 11 December 2024. \nThe industries targeted in this phishing operation included Energy, Fashion, Finance, Aerospace, Manufacturing, Telecommunications, Government, IT, Healthcare, Technology, and Entertainment. \nThis campaign was designed to bypass Secure Email Gateways (SEGs) and evade detection. In particular, the attackers used three main techniques to bypass email security: Trusted Domain Abuse, Dynamic Company Branding, Document Platform Impersonation. In the trusted domain abuse tactic, attackers embedded malicious URLs within legitimate services like Adobe.com and Google AMP, making it harder for security tools to detect. In document platform impersonation, fake DocuSign and Adobe notifications were used to lure users into clicking links for what seem to be important documents. Meanwhile, with dynamic company branding, phishing pages cleverly displayed the victims' company logo and branding by pulling them directly from legitimate websites. Users who clicked the malicious links were directed to convincing login pages pre-filled with their email addresses.",

         "Russian-Based Threat Actor Storm-1837 and Russian State-Sponsored Hacking Group Secret Blizzard (Also Known as Turla) Compromised Military-Related Devices in Ukraine in January 2024",
         "Since December 2023, Microsoft has been monitoring the activities of a Russian threat actor, Storm-1837 (overlapping with threat actors known as Flying Yeti and UAC-0149), targeting devices belonging to Ukrainian military drone operators. In January 2024, a Ukrainian military device was compromised using a Storm-1837 backdoor. The backdoor leveraged the Telegram API to execute a PowerShell cmdlet. This enabled connections to an account on the file-sharing platform Mega, likely for downloading files or commands. A PowerShell dropper observed on the device deployed two encoded files, delivering the Tavdig backdoor and a Symantec binary, enabling further reconnaissance. Secret Blizzard, another actor, used Tavdig to install the KazuarV2 backdoor for persistence and subsequent operations. Microsoft was still investigating whether Secret Blizzard leveraged access to Storm-1837's backdoor or purchased access, which would indicate cooperation. Microsoft assumed that Secret Blizzard likely wanted to exploit this access to gain further strategic access at the ministerial level. The background to this cyber incident was an incident published a week earlier in the first part of the report, which is also available here. In that incident, Secret Blizzard compromised the infrastructure of Pakistani threat actor Storm-0156 to gain access to Afghan government entities' computer systems.",

The flaw allowed unrestricted file uploads and downloads, leading to remote code execution. This vulnerability (CVE-2024-50623) affected versions 5.8.0.21 and earlier and bypassed a previous patch released in October 2024.\nCybersecurity company Huntress wrote in its report of 9 December 2024 that at least ten organizations in industries like consumer goods, food, trucking, and shipping have been impacted, with the most vulnerable systems in the United States. Furthermore, Huntress wrote that the patch offered by Cleo does not work.\nCybersecurity expert Kevin Beaumont commented on the cyber incident on Mastodon on 10 December 2024 and said the Termite ransomware group had a zero-day exploit for those affected products.\nThe Clop ransomware group claimed responsibility for the cyber incident on 15 December 2024.",

The incident came to light because the Spanish international news agency EFE gained access to an order dated 5 December 2024, according to which the incident is to be transferred from the Court of Instruction 27 in Madrid to the National Court of Instruction 3. \nJudge Maria Tardon of the National accepted the competence to investigate the case, classified as a crime of computer attacks and against national security. The Office of the Public Prosecutor opposed this transfer because the CNMC cannot be described as a state institution. Maria Tardon objected, saying that a transfer must meet two criteria: first, the crime must have been committed against a high agency of the nation or a state institution, and second, the dignity or functioning of that institution must be affected.",

Despite the attack, urgent care centers and emergency rooms remained operational. Critical systems such as patient health records, laboratory, pharmacy, radiology, patient registration, and other IT tools were taken offline. Phone service was also disrupted for most locations. PIH Health enlisted third-party cyber forensic specialists to determine the extent of the attack and potential data compromise. The incident was publicly disclosed by PIH Health on its website on 4 December 2024.",

         "On 2 December 2024, Pembina Trails School Division, located in Winnipeg, Manitoba, Canada, was hit by a ransomware attack, resulting in some of its systems, including phone lines, being taken offline. The division's network system was still down on the following day. Pembina Trails staff were informed of the attack on Tuesday, and the division was working on a fix. The specific nature of the cyber security incident and whether any personal data may have been exposed was not revealed. Outside experts were brought in to investigate, and the division was restoring interrupted services and investigating the incident. The division's information technology staff detected unusual activities in the network system on the morning of 2 December. The attack was reported by Supt. and CEO Shelley Amos in a letter to staff and parents, and later commented on by technology analyst and journalist Carmi Levi, who praised the division's quick response to the incident. Levi noted that the attack followed a depressingly familiar trajectory, reflecting a growing realization within the cybercriminal community that schools, school boards, and other public-facing institutions make for highly desirable targets. Levi also stated that the district will ultimately have to share specific guidance on what exactly happened, what's being done to recover from this event, and what steps will be taken to harden its systems, staff, and students against future attacks.

The attackers used three infection vectors, including macro-enabled Word documents and Windows shortcut files, to deliver a malicious dropper called ROAMINGMOUSE, which acted as a dropper for ANEL and NOOPDOOR components. The backdoors were used to capture screenshots, upload/download files, load executables, and run commands via cmd.exe. Trend Micro reported the attack and provided technical analysis.

Apparently, their \"Leonardo\" system (which sounds more like a Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle than a genius inventor) is under attack from \"abroad.\" So, customers of \"Pobeda\" and \"Aeroflot\" can neither book nor check in for flights.

About a third of them were classified as incidents of varying levels of danger. The leader here was the Russian short-haul aircraft \"dry superjet\" - 34 emergency cases.In the first 9 months of 2023, 150 cases of aircraft malfunctions were recorded in Russia. In the same period in 2022, 50 such incidents were recorded. This means that the safety hazard of flying in Russia has tripled.Engines and landing gear, as well as other important elements such as hydraulic systems, flaps and software, remain the most critical issues in Russian aviation.The aggressor state of Russia faces serious challenges in maintaining heavily logged aircraft. Due to the lack of capacity and specialists, Moscow is trying to redirect aircraft maintenance to Iran, where the relevant work is carried out \" handicraft\" - without appropriate certification.As of March 2022, Russia had about 820 foreign-made civilian aircraft. And while at that time only up to 10% of them had undergone uncertified maintenance with the use of non-authentic spare parts, today almost 70% of the fleet has been put through such \"service\".The acute shortage of spare parts has led to the so-called \"aviation cannibalism\" in Russia, when some aircraft are dismantled to repair others.  According to the available data, by mid-2023, more than 35% of aircraft in Russia were \"donated\".Most Soviet An-2 aircraft are currently unable to take off from the ground because their engines were manufactured in Poland, but their supply has been stopped due to sanctions.In January 2023 alone, 19 different failures were recorded among the 220 Airbus aircraft in Russia. In particular, 17 cases of smoke were recorded in 9 aircraft used by Aeroflot.33 technical failures of various aircraft systems have been recorded out of 230 Boeing aircraft operated in Russia.\n10.Every seventh Brazilian Embraer failed to withstand the conditions of operation in Russia, and there are 21 of them in Russia's fleet.\nIn September 2022, the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) marked Russia as red, along with Liberia and Bhutan, which indicates an extremely high risk to flight safety.\nAn analysis of the character of aviation incidents from the documents obtained indicates that a number of failures, especially those related to engines, landing gear and wing mechanics, are of a systemic type. The trend indicates that the civil aviation sector in Russia is in a zone of serious turbulence with a high risk of a steep dive.\nThis reality is a direct consequence of the sanctions, the most painful of which for the aggressor state of Russia were the imposed ban on the supply of aircraft and spare parts;\nrejection of software updates;detention of Russian aircraft abroad;restriction of access to meteorological information for air navigation.\nToday, Moscow is trying to hide the endless pile of problems with civil aviation, endangering its residents, by all means.\nDI of Ukraine\nThe official Telegram bot\nABOUT DIU\nWhat We Do\nThe Leadership of the Defence Intelligence of Ukraine\nHistory of Creation\nDIU's Operations\nOutstanding intelligence officers\nSymbols\nIssues Regarding Captives\nNEWS\nAll News\nArticles\nComments\nInterviews\nStories\nVideos\nLibrary\nForeign Media\nENEMIES of UKRAINE\nRussia's War Criminals\nBook of Executioners of the Ukrainian People\nWar & Sanctions\nCONTACTS\nContacts\nForm and procedure for submitting a journalistic request",

Підкреслюється, що всі атаковані російські ресурси підтримують та фінансують війну проти України.\nКрім цього потужного кіберудару зазнали десятки ресурсів великих промислових обʼєктів РФ, які забезпечують роботу ВПК держави-терористки.\nЗокрема була атакована мережева інфраструктура автозаводу «Чайка-сервіс» (виробляє спеціальну техніку для російських силових відомств), ООО «Контур-НИИРС» (виробляє спеціальне обладнання для літаків та вертольотів), ПАО «ИНЭУМ им. И.С. Брука» (постачає технічні та програмні засоби, сервери, процесори тощо).\nДжерела стверджують, що також були атаковані хмарні та файлові сховища інтернет-провайдера «Mail.ru», VDSina, інтернет-провайдера «Квідекс», ТОВ «Національні кабельні мережі», ПАО «Центральний телеграф» та інші. Крім того, уражено ще щонайменше два десятки ресурсів компаній-виробників світлового обладнання, дизельних станцій, хостинг-провайдерів, виробів балістичного захисту тощо.\nУ результаті кібератаки уражено щонайменше 33 сервери та 283 службових ПЕОМ промислових обʼєктів, знищено 15 хмарних та файлових сховищ, ліквідовано 21 вебсайт. Загальний обсяг знищеної інформації - близько 70 терабайтів. Водночас на місці знищених вебресурсів, українські хакери залишили «заглушки» з агітаційним змістом на підтримку переможних дій України.\n«Це черговий кіберпривіт мешканцям боліт.
